                <h2>More about me:</h2>
                <p>In my free time I help my friends solve various problems with electronic equipment (mobile phones, computers or remotely via Teamviewer). It makes me happy :). Always try to bring the matter to the end and I believe that there are no things that can not be repaired :)</p>
                <p>Recently I have started to learn web development. My goal is to work as a front-end developer. I've already known basics of HTML and CSS. Everyday I practice a lot and learn new things.</p>
